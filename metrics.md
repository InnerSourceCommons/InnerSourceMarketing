# ISC Marketing & Outreach Working Group Metrics

## Overview

The ISC Marketing & Outreach Working Group's goal is to "move the needle" when it comes to InnerSource. This document is to outline the measurements of success for the Working Group's activites and efforts.

## Working Principles

We have agreed the following: 

* We don’t want to drive activity metrics for metrics sake. For example, we would not want to grow the community at the expense of the great culture the ISC has. We favour quality participation and commitment over volume.
* We will set directional goals, to allow for experimentation and agility and avoid activity for activity’s sake. 
* We will also include targets to indicate what success (and failure) would look like. These should not be considered hard targets.
* We will regularly report on agreed set of metrics.
* We will be transparent about directional goals and metrics and share them with the ISC community.

The Marketing & Outreach Working Group covers a broad scope of activites, proposed measures of success are listed below.

## High Level Metrics

Market Adoption of InnerSource:
* Number of individuals practicing InnerSource
* Number of organisations practicing InnerSource
* Number of organisations creating tools or services supporting the practice of InnerSource

Health of the ISC Community:
* Number of participants
* Number of active participants (e.g. have contributed to working groups in past 12 months)
* Growth of community - number of new Slack members

## Activity Metrics

### Communications & Social 

#### What does success look like?

We have a number of channels and ways to communicate with ISC community and the world at large. In general, success looks like high numbers of followers/subscribers and regular engagement with content. 

#### What to measure?

##### Website:
* Website Visits

##### Twitter:
* Followers
* Tweet Impressions
* Mentions

##### YouTube:
* Subscribers

* Watch time
* Top videos 
* % View time

##### LinkedIn:
* Views of content
* Followers of org page

##### Facebook
Although we have a Facebook page, it currently does not receive many views.

For discussion: do we focus on building FB following?

##### GitHub:
* GitHub Stars ?

##### Slack:
* ?

### Events

#### What does success look like?

Success for each event is dependent on the goals for the event. Often, our goal may not be to maximise the number of attendees at ISC events (e.g. summits), but instead to limit the number of attendees to maximise the sense of community. In other cases (e.g. third party events), our goal may be to maximise attendence at our talks in order to raise awareness about InnerSource.

#### What to measure?

* Number of registrations
* Number of attendees
* Liklihood to recommend to a friend
* Feedback
* Number of views of recorded events
* Social activity related to the event
