# Marketing & Outreach Working Group (marketing-wg)

This repo was originally created to contain documents for the Marketing & Outreach Working Group. 

Update from June 2021: It is in the process of converted into a public board for easier on-boarding.

## Original Details

The repo also contains the [project board](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/marketing-wg/projects/1) that we use as to share what we are working on.

## Background

In May 2020, it was proposed we set up a new ISC working group to look at Outreach and Marketing. This document is to give an overview of the working group. It is a starting point and intended to evolve as we work through some of the open questions below. 

## Goals & Purpose

The purpose of the Marketing & Outreach Working Group is to ultimately “move the needle” when it comes to InnerSource.

This includes:
* Increasing the number of individuals and organisations using InnerSource
* Increasing the effectiveness of individuals practicing InnerSource
* Increase the health of the InnerSource Commons community (more people participating and contributing, strong relationships and increased satisfaction).
* Promoting InnerSource success stories to raise awareness about InnerSource.

## Scope

Scope will change over time depending on priorities and resources.

Current ideas for scope include:
* Managing ISC brand and presence 
* Managing ISC website
* ISC Events
* Speaker Bureau and ISC presence at other events.
* Managing ISC social channels and comms (e.g. mailing lists)
* Promoting ISC, assets and resources
* ISC Survey to assess adoption in the market.
* ISC Ambassadors to other orgs 
* State of InnerSource Survey 

## Notes

Many of the activities will be done in collaboration with other working groups (e.g. website changes to the Learning Path page will be managed/approved by Learning Path working group). It’s been proposed that we should have a Learning Path Working Group member attend Outreach & Marketing meetings and have a report on Outreach & Marketing activities regularly at Learning Path Working Group meetings to facilitate close collaboration and alignment. 
Other related working groups may be set up to deal with specific initiatives (e.g. events like the Summits)
