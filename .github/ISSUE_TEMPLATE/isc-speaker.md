Thank you for speaking about InnerSource!
We want those that are speaking at 3rd-party events and conferences to let others know about the ISC and invite them to participate.

Check off these steps!
Feel free to add any more ideas that you have!


# Immediately
- [ ] Fill in the conference name and dates in the title.
- [ ] Assign this issue to yourself.
- [ ] Add this issue to the `Marketing WG` board (In Progress status).
- [ ] (Optional) Also volunteer as an [ISC Gathering Lead](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourceMarketing/issues/new/choose) at the event.

# 4 Weeks Prior
- [ ] Introduce yourself in the [#marketing] channel and ask for some ISC stickers to be shipped to you.

# 1 Week Prior
- [ ] Pack the ISC stickers.
- [ ] Plan to include reference to the InnerSource Commons in your talk.

# Conference Day(s)
- [ ] Speak on InnerSource and mention the InnerSource Commons.
- [ ] Hand out ISC stickers wherever you can.
- [ ] If you meet anyone feels InnerSource-related, invite them to join the [InnerSource Commons Slack].
- [ ] Have fun at the conference!

# Week After
- [ ] Share back in the [#marketing] channel how your experience went.
Better, yet, attend a [#marketing] working group meeting and share on the call!
