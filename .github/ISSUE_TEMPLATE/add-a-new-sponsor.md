## Gathering contact details, logos and information from new sponsor
Once a new sponsor is confirmed, an email address for a key contact will be shared with you by the Executive Director. At this point, you will be in charge of gathering the information needed for ongoing communications, updating the sponsor and content for ISC announcements.

- [ ] Check with the Executive Director if the sponsor will be a Partner or a Supporter of InnerSource Commons.
- [ ] Go to the [Sponsors folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1thHxyqFYfolfPkp7pe_ZccmyXMedKCEA?usp=drive_link) in the [Social Media & Regular Promotion Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JlNK9Fycoe9JaUVhW-Sof6_KHyfyn-hg?usp=drive_link).
- [ ] Save a new copy of the [Sponsor Information Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/118ESzAGnbQB2PkRemAQU0h88zjqMoMBj/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112227356091295695995&rtpof=true&sd=true) as 'Sponsor Info [Company Name].
- [ ] Go to [Sponsor Comms - Template for Emails](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d6my5hWMBJJFfRaUU0CnAZzmnIcST58HDN6VTgHY7Yc/edit?usp=sharing) and use the template email: 'Template email: Contacting Sponsors to obtain key information for sponsor announcements' to make initial contact with Sponsor requesting information. In the email, share the link to the Sponsor Information Doc you've saved with the sponsor's name.
- [ ] When the sponsor responds, add their information in the [Sponsor Contact Details](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HVeVCb9V5lk6UfLZ3PZkTGvoYQcro5epmVahsFq7ucE/edit?usp=sharing) google sheet.

## Update the 'New Sponsor Announcement Slide' for forthcoming announcements on social
When we post on social, we use a slide welcoming the new sponsor. The slide is used on our announcements on Slack, LinkedIn and on X. It can also be shared on the Executive Director's slack announcement to the general channel. Depending on the size or shape of the logo, the slide may need to be tweaked slightly.

- [ ] Go to [Sponsor Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KpDdwv_YziTvdl5arFcCCVs31l547VGcOUT9BY96XYA/edit?usp=sharing).
- [ ] Duplicate the first slide
- [ ] Update text to either 'Partner' or 'Supporter'. 
- [ ] Add the new Sponsor's logo to the slide.
- [ ] Save the file and then download the new slide for future social announcements.

## Update the sponsors slide for Community Calls and events
We also use a specific slide that displays all our sponsors. This slide is used at the beginning of all our Community Calls and events and any other recordings. 

**Once the sponsor has been announced, the updated sponsor slide must be used at the next ISC Community Call or relevant event.**

- [ ] Share the logo (and any branding guidelines about the use of the sponsor's logo) with the person on the team who has responsibility for updating the sponsor slides and ensure that they have enough time to update the slide before the next Community Call.

## Linking in with Sponsors
If the sponsors do not complete the Sponsor Information Template by the agreed date, send on a gentle reminder and get a sense of when it's possible for them to share the information you're waiting on.

## Writing announcement content
All social content and the slack announcement should be reviewed by the Executive Director in advance.

- [ ] Draft the announcements for the social channels and slack in [Sponsor Announcements - 2023 onwards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13MwFKCEi7Yfinbn8hyUdJe07ADoNXi6a/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112227356091295695995&rtpof=true&sd=true)

- [ ] Start at the top of the document and follow the format of the other sponsor announcements with the: 
- Month of the Announcement
- [Company Name]
- Add Sponsor Announcement Slide
- Add text for LinkedIn post
- Add text for X post
- Add text for Slack channel post
- Add text for Newsletter
- [ ] Share content with Executive Director for final sign off
- [ ] Agree with Executive Director on the scheduled and **date** for making the slack announcement and when to update the sponsors page on the website.

- [ ] Confirm the date of the announcement with our IT support and/or another member of the ISC Marketing Team so that they can merge your update to the website on schedule.

## Day of the Announcement
On the day of the announcement, complete these tasks in the following order:
1. Update the [Sponsors](https://innersourcecommons.org/about/sponsors/) page of the website with the new sponsors logo.
2. Post the announcement on our social channels (LinkedIn, X, etc).
3. Slack announcement from the Executive Director.
4. Update the sponsor about the announcements.

### Update the Website
Follow the steps below to add the sponsor's logo and company name to [Sponsors page](https://innersourcecommons.org/about/sponsors/).

- [ ] Rename the logo file of the new Sponsor as: [company_name].png
- [ ] Upload this file in the static/images/logos folder on the website 
- [ ] Open the sponsors.md file located in the folder: content/about
- [ ] Go to the relevant section in this file (if adding a Partner go to the first section - Our Partners. If adding a Supporter go to the second section - Our Supporters.
- [ ] Copy and paste the following line of code in the correct place, following the alphabetical order:
{{< company name="[company name]" image="/images/logos/[company_name].png" >}}{{< /company >}}
- [ ] Save your changes and make sure to test the result before creating the pull request

N.B. If you're not confident adding a new logo to the sponsors page, let our IT support know and they can provide support.

### Update community channels and social media
Ideally, the social posts will happen on the same day that the sponsors page is updated. The posts that include the new sponsor announcement slide should be scheduled in the following order:
- [ ] Create a LinkedIn post tagging the sponsor and relevant key contacts
- [ ] Create an X post tagging the sponsor and relevant key contacts
- [ ] Add social links to the Slack post and notify the Executive Director that the announcement is ready to be posted on the  general channel. The sponsor and their key contacts should also be tagged in this post (if they are on slack).
