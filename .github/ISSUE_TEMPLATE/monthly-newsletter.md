## Newsletter Checklist:

Related information can be found in [these instructions](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/foundation-governance/blob/master/how-to/add-content-to-newsletter.md).

### Gathering Content

**1 month before publication**
   -  [ ] Gathering content in advance: Add any interesting InnerSource content from slack or social scans or keyword searches for InnerSource / #InnerSource on our social platforms to the next month’s Newsletter Issue in the [GitHub marketing](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourceMarketing/issues) repo.


**2 weeks before publication**
 - [ ] You may want to ask members for any content they want to contribute. You can do this by sharing a reminder on slack with a link to that month’s Newsletter GitHub issue. 
(If you do this, be sure to give members a deadline a few days in advance.)
 - [ ] If you’re posting about a new pattern or a pattern of the month, then be sure to get in touch on the #innersource-patterns channel to say what pattern you plan to post about and see if anyone has any thoughts
 - [ ] Check in with the team on who should be the Hero of the Month. 
 - [ ] Check in with Olive about your deadline for working on the newsletter and whether registration links for Community Calls will be ready on time. (We usually issue a brief second update with details of a community call if it’s not confirmed before the deadline.)

### 2 Days before Publication - Drafting the newsletter

- The [Social Media Calendar 2025](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12lF2qGSNwxxelIQ2_nq7QLq-Ill6ad2R/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112227356091295695995&rtpof=true&sd=true) suggests dates for working on and publishing the newsletter.
- We create and send our newsletter using [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/).
- Here is a [90 minute video with all the instructions you should need](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mCZShH5yOj4sKUpKksXGeSkCgiJGHxNw/view?usp=sharing) for creating your monthly newsletter.

**A few pointers**

- All the newsletter images you need should be found here on Canva:
  - [Community Call Eventbrite Heading Images slides](https://www.canva.com/design/DAE7I9K26k8/q5BJv0-hhtbD5cyRfzTDyA/edit)
  - [Newsletter Headings](https://www.canva.com/design/DAE6AmIoJGM/8cDqAMRslk72fvBG5OQwUQ/edit)
  - [Gathering Presentation Slides](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGS5LFv9aU/upxC5BMSGGqp0xmZ_bNXFQ/edit)
  - The Hero of the Month images are saved [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m4rGMjuxz7IgoTDK6-LSKRxDaJ5LB1wB?usp=sharing) in the Social Media & Regular promotion folder.
  - My go to is unsplash.com when I’m looking for copyright free images.
  - We use Helvetica, size 15 font for the main body of the text.

- [ ] Go through all the steps in the 90 minute video from above

### 1 Day before Publication - Editing the newsletter

- [ ] Send test emails:
   - [ ] 1st test email: Check that each link is correct
   - [ ] 2nd test email: Review that content is correct - especially dates and time for the community calls and events
   - [ ] 3rd test email: Re-read and do a spell check in your email and by copying and pasting the content in a word document (the word document hack has been really useful for me).
- [ ] Email link: You need to update the month every time and I always add the year.  
 
### Sending and sharing the Newsletter
Once you’re happy that the edit has been comprehensive, it’s time to send the newsletter using Mailchimp. (This is covered in the video instructions.

After sending out the newsletter, you then need to share it on social media
 - [ ] Find an attention-grabbing image to use for the post (I use unsplash.com)
 - [ ] Draft content to use with sharing the post. The content of the post is always very simple and along the lines of … ‘Hurrah, the [month] newsletter has hit the shelves’ and include a hashtag for #InnerSource
 - [ ] Share to Linked In
 - [ ] Share to X and Mastodon
 - [ ] Share to InnerSource Commons Slack. (Once again, it’s a very similar short message that gets posted on the #general channel that contains the LinkedIn and social links in case people want to repost.)
 - [ ] Share to other channels as needed, where it may be of particular interest e.g.
    - the #innersource-patterns channel where I tag the people involved with that pattern
    - the #marketing working group as a few members repost on social for us
    - our Hero of the Month
    - anyone who has advertised an event or activity with us.
