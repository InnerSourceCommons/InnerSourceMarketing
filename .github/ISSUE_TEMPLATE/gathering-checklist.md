> **First things first:** This is YOUR community's event. You know what your local InnerSource practitioners need better than anyone. The Marketing WG is here to support and amplify your efforts, not to direct how you run it. We do have a few guidelines to ensure consistency across ISC events - please check those below.

## üìã The Essential Three

While we want you to have freedom in organizing, these three things help us support you and maintain the InnerSource Commons community standards:

1. **Tell us when it's happening and what you're planning** - So we can promote and support you
2. **Check brand usage** - Quick review if using ISC logos/name
3. **Share your story** - Brief report to help future organizers

Everything else? That's up to you!
