README:
The template below provides an sample format for how new ideas/tasks for the Marketing & Outreach working group should be described.

The text below just provides examples, to make it easier to understand what we mean.

Please replace all text below with your own information.

### Title

A short summary of what you want to do. 

Place this short summary in the title of the GitHub issue.
You can delete the whole `### Title` section from here.

Example:
> InnerSource Commons 101 document for newcomers


### Purpose & Details

Description of what you want to do in more detail.
It is especially important that you describe the purpose here i.e. how will this contribute to the goals of the Marketing & Outreach working group?

Sometimes it can be helpful to describe things in the user story format, to make sure you understand who you are doing this for, and what the purpose is. A common user story format would be this:
“As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”

Example:

> With the InnerSource Commons 101 document we want to give newcommers to the InnerSource Commons community a birds-eye view of our community, so that they have an easier time navigating it and figure out what is happening here, and how to get involved.


### Acceptance Criteria

How will we know that this is done?

Example:

> - We have produced a first InnerSource Commons 101 document (as a Google Doc).
> - We have shared the document with users that have joined in the last 2 months
> - We have added the doc to the #general channel, so that Newcomers can find it. (pinned / channel topic)


### Help Needed / Blockers

- Are there any dependencies to people outside of our Working Group? Where is help needed, or what could block progress on this?
- (if you already know that) How do you want to achieve consensus after finishing the issue? e.g. is lazy consensus in the WG enough, or do you need more than that?
